These are the python projects I worked on for the first module of my 2 year, part-time masters degree in Machine Learning in Finance from the University of Limerick. 

These are early stage rough work, and I'm hoping to show my progression over time as I improve my python skills. 

The first module was an intro class to scientific computing. We covered topics such as Calculus (Derivation, Integration, etc), Linear Algebra (matrix maniuplation), statistics & probability.
